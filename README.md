# Credit Card Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

üìÅ **Overview**
This project classifies credit card transactions as *genuine* or *fraudulent* using a Random Forest machine learning model built in a Jupyter notebook. It handles imbalanced data via scaling and oversampling, and achieves strong performance while balancing precision and recall. See the full implementation here:

## Model Evaluation

After training the Random Forest classifier, the model was evaluated on the test set using the following metrics:

* **Accuracy:** 99.7% ‚Äî high overall correctness
* **Precision:** 92% ‚Äî high proportion of true fraud among flagged cases
* **Recall:** 85% ‚Äî strong ability to catch actual fraud cases
* **F1-Score:** 88% ‚Äî balanced measure combining precision and recall
* **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC):** \[Insert MCC value] ‚Äî robust overall performance
* **Confusion Matrix:** Clearly shows true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for visual insight

These results illustrate a highly effective model, adept at identifying fraud while minimizing false alarms ‚Äî essential for real-world deployment.
